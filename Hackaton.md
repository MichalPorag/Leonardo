2. [Play with Example](http://outbrain.github.io/Leonardo/examples/angularIL/)
3. [Set Up development environment](https://github.com/outbrain/Leonardo#running-and-contributing)
4. [Give us a :star:](https://github.com/outbrain/Leonardo)
 
#### Goals:
- Create an extension that will inject the leonardo script into any site.
- Turn Leonardo on and off via the extension instead of an added image.
- Option to save deep link urls in extension - simple new feature.
- Attach a url to a scenario - new feature.
- Activate a scenario from a small pop up extension window.
- Perhaps open it in a new window so no need to inject into the page - low priority.
