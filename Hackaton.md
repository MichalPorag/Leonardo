2. [Play with Example](http://outbrain.github.io/Leonardo/examples/angularIL/)
3. [Set Up development environment](https://github.com/outbrain/Leonardo#running-and-contributing)
4. [Give us a :star:](https://github.com/outbrain/Leonardo)
 
#### Goals:
1) Create an extension that will inject the leonardo script into any site.
2) Turn Leonardo on and off via the extension instead of an added image.
3) Option to save deep link urls in extension - simple new feature.
4) Attach a url to a scenario - new feature.
5) Activate a scenario from a small pop up extension window.
4) Perhaps open it in a new window so no need to inject into the page - low priority.
